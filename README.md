### About the Experiment 
Same types of objects are typically implemented by class in object oriented programming. As the structural unit of the system can be represented through the classes, so, it is very important to identify the classes before start implementing all the logical flows of the system.

In this experiment we will learn how to identify the classes from a given problem statement.
